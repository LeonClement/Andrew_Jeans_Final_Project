        <header><h1>Semiweekly Podcasts and Community Highlights! 03/15/2020</h1></header>
       <p>Hello everyone, welcome back to your weekly dosage of NEOS news! This week we’ll be talking about our new semiweekly podcast, 
           brought to you by our wonderful Team member, Coffee!</p>
       <p>We’re moving our release schedule around a little bit to adjust to the Neos Team’s new work schedules, our Friday night streams
            will still remain on Friday, some time between 6-6:30 PM Eastern.</p>
       <p>The Weekly Update will be releasing on Sundays in the evening, specific time pending. The semiweekly podcasts will be Sunday 3 
           PM Eastern (12 noon PST) and Wednesday 10:30 PM Eastern (7:30 PM PST).</p>
       <p>We’re also sorry for missing the weekly update last week! Frooxius, our project lead, had his wisdom tooth pulled last week and 
           was out of commission, so last week was pretty quiet. Hopefully this week updates and details will make up for it!</p>

            and how it ties into VR in general! If you want to join the cast, please contact Coffee about joining!</p>
