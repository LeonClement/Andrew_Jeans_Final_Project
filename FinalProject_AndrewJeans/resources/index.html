            <h1>What is Neos</h1>

        </header>
        <p>Neos is a virtual reality metaverse that reinvents and generalizes the way social
            experiences and various virtual creations are built, to let them all coexist in one shared
            space. The innovative underlying architecture, based on simple, yet powerful building
            blocks in an expandable future-proof way, is designed to dynamically synchronize
            complex worlds and behaviors built directly from within Neos. With a rapidly growing
            community, the potential for a rich Neos in-verse economy emerges as a way for
            content creators and service providers to make a living in Neos, and help it to grow into
            a vibrant, desirable place: a spatial computing platform of choice.

            <h1>Personal Thoughts</h1>
        </header>
        <p>Neos' ability to capture the essence of creation is incredible. The sandbox feel you get from the ability of being able to do 
            exactly what you want is unlike any other creation program I've seen, and this is before mentioning that the platform is entirely within VR.</p>

            <h1>Socialization</h1>
        </header>
        <p>Neos isn't just a creation engine either, it's also a place where you can go to socialize with many other people and explore the wacky creations they've made.</p>

            <h1>Programming Ability</h1>
        </header>
        <p>Neos also has a realtime visual scripting language based off c#. It's entire it's own identity, though, and is insanely intuitive.</p>
